## NAME

autojump - a faster way to navigate your filesystem

## SYNOPSIS

Jump to a previously visited directory 'foobar':

    j foo

Show all database entries and their respective key weights:

    jumpstat

## DESCRIPTION

autojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem. It works by
maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the
command line. The jumpstat command shows you the current contents of the
database. Directories must be visited first before they can be jumped
to.

## OPTIONS

Options must be passed to 'autojump' and not the 'j' wrapper function.

    -a, --add DIR       manually add path to database

    --stat              show database entries and their key weights

    --version           show version information and exit

## INTERNAL OPTIONS

    -b, --bash          enclose directory with quotes to prevent errors

    --completion        prevent key weight decay over time

## ADVANCED USAGE

-   Prefer Symbolic Links

    Default behavior is to evaluate symbolic links into full paths as to
    reduce duplicate entries in the database. However, some users prefer
    a shorter working directory path in their shell prompt. To switch
    behavior to prefer symbolic links, export the following
    configuration in your \~/.bashrc:

        export AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS=1

-   Change Directory Weight

    To manually change a directory's key weight, you can edit the file
    *$XDG\_DATA\_HOME/autojump/autojump.txt*. Each entry has two
    columns. The first is the key weight and the second is the path:

        29.3383211216   /home/user/downloads

    All negative key weights are purged automatically.

## FILES

If installed locally, autojump is self-contained in *\~/.autojump/*.

The database is stored in *$XDG\_DATA\_HOME/autojump/autojump.txt*.
